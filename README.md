This project was done as a part of sem-project of SMK Sai Krishna, first year master student in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence at IITM Zanzibar Campus.
I, Manas Pandya, a first year bachelors student in the same field, have assisted and collaborated in the project.

The project in it's current state has been completed on JAN 2024.

CONTEXT:
Many of the parts in modern machines are required that cannot be manufactured without casting them (yep, exactly what it sounds like- heat up the metal till it's liquid and pour it into a stronger cast).

Problems most commonly arise are defects in the casts. We have done this project to automate finding the defects.

We have used over half a dozen machine learning algorithms and then used them to make the ensemble classifier for this purpose.

For now, we have only implemented the code to differentiate defects from non-defects. Future advancements could include finding out what type of defect is actually present.

THE DATASET HAS BEEN TAKEN FROM THE FOLLOWING KAGGLE LINK: https://www.kaggle.com/code/ginsaputra/visual-inspection-of-casting-products-using-cnn/notebook
